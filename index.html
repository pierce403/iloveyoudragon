            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 1: Embrace Your Inner Dragon</h3>
                <p>Close your eyes and imagine the friendliest dragon you can think of. That's you! Believe in yourself and your ability to be kind, gentle, and magical.</p>
            </div>

                <h3>Step 2: Practice Your Dragon Smile</h3>
                <p>Dragons have big mouths with lots of teeth, but friendly dragons use them for smiling! Practice your biggest, warmest smile in the mirror. Remember, a dragon's smile can light up the whole sky!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 3: Learn the Dragon Dance</h3>
                <p>Move your arms like wings, stomp your feet gently, and sway your imaginary tail. This special dance helps awaken your inner dragon and makes everyone around you happy!</p>
            </div>
            <div class="step">
                <h3>Step 4: Master Your Dragon Breath</h3>
                <p>Instead of fire, friendly dragons breathe sparkles and bubbles! Take a deep breath and blow out slowly, imagining colorful sparkles floating through the air. Practice until you can create a dazzling display!</p>
